# Source Code

## Notes

- The code is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose.

- There are comments sprinkled throughout the code not just to explain the functionality, but also to point out areas that need improvement or further development. Here are some comments to look out for:
  - `TODO`: These are tasks that need to be completed.
  - `FIXME`: These are areas that need to be fixed or improved.
  - `MARK`: These are low-priority tasks or areas that need attention but are not urgent.
Let's agree from here to treat `TODO` and `FIXME` as similar, and higher priority issues, while `MARK` is lower priority.
