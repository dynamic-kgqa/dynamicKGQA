    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subgraph Processing**  \n",
    "  The pipeline begins by taking a subgraph as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **QA Pair Generation**  \n",
    "  It uses placeholder models (currently GPT-4o via API) to generate question-answer pairs along with supporting paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation**  \n",
    "  These QA pairs are then evaluated using annotator models. Currently, we use:\n",
    "  - Phi-3\n",
    "  - Two versions of GPT (API-based)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** All models used here are placeholders.  \n",
    "> We plan to replace them with relevant models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) to support easier integration and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to start with the models mentioned in the paper, but the setup is flexible and can accommodate others as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infrastructure Support\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need more compute power, I can spin up a **larger VM with better GPUs** â€” just let me know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Should Do\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore the notebook and run through the workflow\n",
    "- Get familiar with how each component fits into the overall pipeline\n",
    "- Feel free to modify and test with different models\n",
