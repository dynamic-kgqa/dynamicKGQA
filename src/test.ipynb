    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subgraph Processing**  \n",
    "  The pipeline begins by taking a subgraph as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **QA Pair Generation**  \n",
    "  It uses placeholder models (currently GPT-4o via API) to generate question-answer pairs along with supporting paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation**  \n",
    "  These QA pairs are then evaluated using annotator models. Currently, we use:\n",
    "  - Phi-3\n",
    "  - Two versions of GPT (API-based)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** All models used here are placeholders.  \n",
    "> We plan to replace them with relevant models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) to support easier integration and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to start with the models mentioned in the paper, but the setup is flexible and can accommodate others as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infrastructure Support\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need more compute power, I can spin up a **larger VM with better GPUs** â€” just let me know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Should Do\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore the notebook and run through the workflow\n",
    "- Get familiar with how each component fits into the overall pipeline\n",
    "- Feel free to modify and test with different models\n",

      "You are an AI assistant tasked with generating question-answer pairs from knowledge graph triples. Your goal is to create natural, human-like questions and their corresponding answers based on the provided graph data.\n",
      "\n",

      "Generate **multi-hop, complex Q&A pairs** where the questions appear simple and natural but require reasoning across multiple connected relationships within the graph to infer the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines for Generating Q&A Pairs:\n",
      "1. **Question Design**:\n",
      "- Questions should utilize multiple connected relationships in the graph, requiring multi-hop reasoning.\n",
      "- Avoid single-hop or trivial questions directly derived from a single triple.\n",
      "- The answer should be an entity or node in the graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Multi-Hop Reasoning**:\n",
      "- Use paths connecting entities indirectly through multiple relationships to infer answers.\n",
      "- Questions should reflect meaningful and interesting connections within the graph.\n",
      "- Aim for question with at least 4 hops or higher whenever possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Answer Validation**:\n",
      "- Ensure each answer is fully supported by one or more triples from the graph.\n",
      "- Include the exact path (a sequence of triples) that justifies the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Comprehensive Coverage**:\n",
      "- Generate as many high-quality Q&A pairs as possible, exploring all meaningful paths and connections within the graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Fallback Condition**:\n",
      "- If no valid Q&A pairs can be generated from the graph, explicitly indicate this in the response.\n",
